          Thanks for dropping by! Here's a little bit about what kind of content
          you can expect from me. I care deeply about{" "}
          <Link href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/">prison reform</Link>{" "}
          and helping the formerly incarcerated. I also talk about{" "}
          <Link href="https://fullstack.health/">mental health</Link>, drug
          addiction, and neurodiversity. Oh, and once in awhile I write about
          developer advocacy and software development!
