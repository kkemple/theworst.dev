I've been thinking a lot over the last few years about how vital the distribution of challenge is to a team's success.

In fact, it's one of the primary considerations I have when building a team.

How many developers do you know who have left their job because either 1) the work is no longer challenging / there is no career growth, or 2) the work is too challenging, and they have no support?

Challenge plays an essential role in our happiness.

However, making sure that everyone on a team, in an org, or in a company is adequately challenged is a complicated task.

In response, I've developed a model called the `Pyramid of Challenge` that I use whenever I am managing others.

## The Pryamid of Challenge

The model is composed of a triangle which represents a group's entire workload. The `x axis` represents the amount of work available and the `y axis` represents the complexity of the work available. Together they represent that as work increases in complexity, it decreases in availablity.

![an illustration titled "Pyramid of Challenge" shows a triangle to the left with a label at the top that says "architectural and systems development challenges" another label half way up the triangle that says "application development challenges" and a label near the bottom of the triangle that says "feature development challenges"](/pyramid-of-challenge.png)

Ensuring everyone is challenged is about ensuring everyone on the team has the correct workload.

## Balancing the Distribution of Challenge

In order to have a balanced distribution of challange, you need a team makeup that doesn't leave any gaps in the pyramid or put too many people into one part of the pyramid, creating a `challenge gap`.

> A challenge gap is an area of responsibility for a team that doesn't have anyone challenged by that work.

When you compare that previous illustration to most teams today, it's starkly different. So is this a practical model?

If we apply the model to the responsibilities of a team tasked with building an application, you can see that it holds up. As the work decreases in complexity it increases in availability.

![an illustration titled "Frontend Team Pyramid of Challenge" that has a triangle to the left and three labels on the right. The top label reads: "Chooses technologies, organizes the project, documents best practices and expected workflows. Manages project infrastructure." the middle label reads: "Builds out the application based on the building blocks provided. Creates higher level abstractions to improve DX for other developers on the team. Manages project health." and the bottom label reads "Builds the atomic pieces of the application and brings them together into features."](/pyramid-of-challenge-frontend-example.png)

> You only need 1 or 2 people to architect an application, but you'll need many more to build it.

**So why is this important?**

It's important because if we don't provide people with the right level of responsibilities so that they are properly challenged it could grind your team's productivity to a halt.

With a model to work from, let's look at some of the most common team makeups you'll come across and discuss some of the challenge gaps they face.

> A challenge gap is an area of responsibility for a team that doesn't have anyone challenged by that work.

## Analyzing Common Distributions of Challenge

### Top Distribution of Challenge

Let's start with the most common distribution of challenge, the top distribution. If a team has too many senior members, it suffers from a challenge gap at the bottom of the pyramid.

![illustration titled "Top Distribution of Challenge" that shows many people bunched together at the top of a triangle with none at the bottom, representing a gap in challenge being filled.](/top-distribution-of-challenge.png)

Senior developers are forced to do the less complex and more frequent tasks even though it's not challenging, essentially leaving them toiling.

### Bottom Distribution of Challenge

Another makeup we see often is bottom-distributed teams or a team without enough seniorty or leadership. These teams suffer from a challenge gap at the top of the pyramid.

![illustration titled "Bottom Distribution of Challenge" that shows many people bunched together at the bottom of a triangle with none at the top, representing a gap in challenges covered.](/bottom-distribution-of-challenge.png)

These teams face a situation where they are overchallenged by not having the skills/experience needed to meet their responsibilities.

### Opposing Distribution of Challenge

Another makeup you might see is the opposing distribution of challenges. These teams tend to have one or two very senior people and then more junior developers.

These teams face a challenge gap at the center of the pyramid.

![illustration titled "Opposing Distribution of Challenge" that shows people at the top and bottom of the pyramid with no one in the middle, representing a gap in challenges covered.](/opposing-distribution-of-challenge.png)

With an opposing distribution of challenges, senior developers will be forced to work on all non-challenging tasks that more junior developers aren't capable of handling yet, while also tyring to mentoring them.

This will greatly impact their ability to handle their own responsibilities while other responsibilities get dropped or mishandled.

The less experienced developers won't get the support they need and will often be tasked with work outside their current skillset.

### Centered Distribution of Challenge

Lastly, we have a centered distribution of challenges. In this scenario, teams consist of mid-level developers but lack any really senior or more junior developers creating a challenge gap at each end of the pyramid.

![illustration titled "Centered Distribution of Challenge" that shows people gathered in the middle of the pyramid with no one at the top or bottom, representing a gap in challenges covered.](/centered-distribution-of-challenge.png)

Teams with this makeup are susceptible to infighthing as developers seek out the challenging work. Some of the work could be too complex causing fragility in the solutions.

It's possible teams of this makeup to be very process heavy as well.

## A Framework for Growth

Another significant benefit I've found from using this model is that it creates a system that makes it easier to scale a team or teams as you take on more responsibility because the pyramid can be applied to any level of challenge.

![an illustration titled "Scaling the Distribution of Challenge" that shows a triangle with three labels, at the top is "CTO" the middle label says "Tech Leads" and the lower label says "Individual Contributors". inside the triangle are people icons with them distributed with the most at the bottom, some in the middle, and only one at the top, some of the people icons are dotted lines indicating they are spots to fill on the team, some of the people icons also have arrows by them pointing up to the next row of people indicating moving up in responsibility](/scaling-the-distribution-of-challenge.png)

## Caveats & Conclusion

When it comes to humans we're better served by communication than models.

While this model might help you identify potential gaps in challenge, it's more important to constantly check in with your team and make sure they are in fact happy, engaged, and challenged appropriately.
