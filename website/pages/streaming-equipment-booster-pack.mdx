I needed to curate some equipment for streaming recently and figured it could be useful to a lot of folks, so I decided to share [this Notion doc](https://www.notion.so/Streaming-Equipment-Booster-Pack-05f612246f51444691c94975b8680b34)! A few notes about the list!

- This isn't a getting started pack! It's to boost your streaming or A/V setup! Meaning that you shouldn't invest this much money or effort into your setup unless you are looking to take your audio and video to a professional level.
- It's not just for live streaming either! With more and more interactions happening remotely, having high quality audio and video can set you apart from the rest!
- The total cost of equipment in the list ranges from around $2,500 - $5000 depending on your noise cancelling needs.

I hope this list is useful to you and I'd love to hear what you think or what equipment you recommend! Link to my Twitter is below! 👇
