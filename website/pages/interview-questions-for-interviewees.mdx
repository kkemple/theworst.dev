Interviewing is no fun, it's stressful and often times you're so focused on performing well that when your interviewer asks, "Do you have any questions for me?", you're left staring at them while your mind goes blank and you ask if they like it there. Don't let that happen to you next time! I can't stress how important it is to ask questions during interviews to get a grasp on the company and look for red flags! Write down a few of your favorites from the list below and you'll be much better prepared to answer that question, as well as have a much better idea of the company as a whole.

Because I recently had to interview I figured I'd share the questions I use during interviews and a bunch of folks from the community responded with their favorites as well. Because it was so popular I decided I'd make it a blog post and a bit easier to parse than a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kurtkemple/status/1233753578210242560).
